0.6.0.0:
    This release supports GHC 7.8, 7.10, 8.0 and 8.2.

    Breaking changes:

        'Math.NumberTheory.Moduli' was split into
        'Math.NumberTheory.Moduli.{Chinese,Class,Jacobi,Sqrt}'.

        Functions 'jacobi' and 'jacobi'' return 'JacobiSymbol'
        instead of 'Int'.

        Functions 'invertMod', 'powerMod' and 'powerModInteger' were removed,
        as well as their unchecked counterparts. Use new interface to
        modular computations, provided by 'Math.NumberTheory.Moduli.Class'.

    New functions:

        Brand new 'Math.NumberTheory.Moduli.Class' (#56), providing
        flexible and type safe modular arithmetic. Due to use of GMP built-ins
        it is also significantly faster.

        New function 'divisorsList', which is lazier than 'divisors' and
        does not require 'Ord' constraint (#64). Thus, it can be used
        for 'GaussianInteger'.

    Improvements:

        Speed up factorisation over elliptic curve up to 15x (#65).

        Polymorphic 'fibonacci' and 'lucas' functions, which previously
        were restricted to 'Integer' only (#63). This is especially useful
        for modular computations, e. g., 'map fibonacci [1..10] :: [Mod 7]'.

        Make 'totientSum' more robust and idiomatic (#58).

0.5.0.1:
    Switch to QuickCheck 2.10.

0.5.0.0:
    This release supports GHC 7.8, 7.10 and 8.0. GHC 7.6 is no longer supported.

    Breaking changes:

        Remove deprecated interface to arithmetic functions (divisors, tau,
        sigma, totient, jordan, moebius, liouville, smallOmega, bigOmega,
        carmichael, expMangoldt). New interface is exposed via
        Math.NumberTheory.ArithmeticFunctions (#30).

        Deprecate integerPower and integerWordPower from
        Math.NumberTheory.Powers.Integer. Use (^) instead (#51).

        Math.NumberTheory.Logarithms has been moved to the separate package
        integer-logarithms (#51).

        Rename Math.NumberTheory.Lucas to Math.NumberTheory.Recurrencies.Linear.

    New functions:

        Add basic combinatorial sequences: binomial coefficients, Stirling
        numbers of both kinds, Eulerian numbers of both kinds, Bernoulli
        numbers (#39). E. g.,

        > take 10 $ Math.NumberTheory.Recurrencies.Bilinear.bernoulli
        [1 % 1,(-1) % 2,1 % 6,0 % 1,(-1) % 30,0 % 1,1 % 42,0 % 1,(-1) % 30,0 % 1]

        Add the Riemann zeta function on non-negative integer arguments (#44).
        E. g.,

        > take 5 $ Math.NumberTheory.Zeta.zetas 1e-15
        [-0.5,Infinity,1.6449340668482262,1.2020569031595945,1.0823232337111381]

    Improvements:

        Speed up isPrime twice; rework millerRabinV and isStrongFermatPP (#22, #25).

0.4.3.0:
    This release supports GHC 7.6, 7.8, 7.10 and 8.0.

    Add Math.NumberTheory.ArithmeticFunctions with brand-new machinery
    for arithmetic functions: divisors, tau, sigma, totient, jordan,
    moebius, liouville, smallOmega, bigOmega, carmichael, expMangoldt (#30).
    Old implementations (exposed via Math.NumberTheory.Primes.Factorisation
    and Math.NumberTheory.Powers.Integer) are deprecated and will be removed
    in the next major release.

    Add Karatsuba sqrt algorithm, improving performance on large integers (#6).

    Fix incorrect indexing of FactorSieve (#35).

0.4.2.0:
    This release supports GHC 7.6, 7.8, 7.10 and 8.0.

    Add new cabal flag check-bounds, which replaces all unsafe array functions with safe ones.

    Add basic functions on Gaussian integers.
    Add Moebius mu-function.

    Forbid non-positive moduli in Math.NumberTheory.Moduli.

    Fix out-of-bounds error in Math.NumberTheory.Primes.Heap, Math.NumberTheory.Primes.Sieve and Math.NumberTheory.MoebiusInversion.
    Fix 32-bit build.
    Fix binaryGCD on negative numbers.
    Fix highestPower (various issues).

0.4.1.0:
    Add integerLog10 variants at Bas van Dijk's request and expose
    Math.NumberTheory.Powers.Integer, with an added integerWordPower.
0.4.0.4:
    Update for GHC-7.8, the type of some primops changed, they return Int# now
    instead of Bool.
    Fixed bugs in modular square roots and factorisation.
0.4.0.3:
    Relaxed dependencies on mtl and containers
    Fixed warnings from GHC-7.5, Word(..) moved to GHC.Types
    Removed SPECIALISE pragma from inline function (warning from 7.5, probably
    pointless anyway)
0.4.0.2:
    Sped up factor sieves. They need more space now, but the speedup is worth it, IMO.
    Raised spec-constr limit in MoebiusInversion.Int
0.4.0.1:
    Fixed Haddock bug
0.4.0.0:
    Added generalised Moebius inversion, to be continued
0.3.0.0:
    Added modular square roots and Chinese remainder theorem
0.2.0.6:
    Performance tweaks for powerModInteger (~10%) and
    invertMod (~25%).

    Fix bug in nthPrime

    Fix bug in powerMod

    Relax bounds on array dependency for 7.4.*
0.2.0.1:
    Fix copy-pasto (only relevant for 7.3.*)
    Fix imports for ghc >= 7.3

    Added certificates and certified testing/factorisation

    Fixed doc bugs

    Elaborate on overflow, work more on native Ints in Eratosthenes
0.1.0.0:
    First release
